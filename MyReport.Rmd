```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## This is an Example of a dinamic report

The first name is:    `r data_individual[1]`
The last name is:     `r data_individual[2]`

This let you print *`r data_individual[3]`*

The square root of `r data_individual[4]`is `r format(data_individual[5], ,digits = 5, nsmall = 5)`.

You can also pass on pre-formatted rmarkdown text link we are doing here with this bullet point:

```{r, echo=FALSE, results='asis'} 
        cat(as.character(data_individual[6]))
```
<!-- the asis will output the text excaly as it is, so that you get the formating, it doesn't work with latex code -->
